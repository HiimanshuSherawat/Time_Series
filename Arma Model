An ARMA model, or Autoregressive Moving Average model, is used to describe weakly stationary stochastic time series in terms of two polynomials.

The first of these polynomials is for autoregression, the second for the moving average.

This is a model that is combined from the AR and MA models.

In this model, the impact of previous lags along with the residuals is considered for forecasting the future values of the time series.
